      This HTML file is a template.
      If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.

      You can add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to this file.
      The build step will place the bundled scripts into the <body> tag.

      i.e. Webpack is using a set of default configuration and plugins to transpile all es6 code, bundle up all you javascript and csss and then serve it all up. consider that a black box for now
      because it's both annoying to work with and not relevant to our discussion at hand for today.

      just know that there is essentially a phantom line getting injected into this page at build which looks like...
      <script src="index_bundle.js"></script> or <script src="bundle.js"></script>
      and that's were our (soon to be gigantic) (react library-ized) script for this page is inserted, which gives us the power of a UI DEMIGOD



      To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
      To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
